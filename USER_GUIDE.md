## How to use the application (Step by Step)

The application works like an "assistant" that takes you by the hand through 4 simple steps.

### Step 1: Location
The first thing is to indicate **where** the problem occurred.
*   **Interactive Map:** You will see a map on the screen. You can move and zoom.
*   **Detect my location:** Press the button for the system to find your current position automatically.
*   **Search:** Type the street, neighborhood, or city in the search bar.
*   **Manual Adjustment:** If the detected address is not exact, you can edit it manually by typing the correct address.
*   **Confirm:** Once the marker is in the correct place, press "Confirm Location".

### Step 2: Information
Here you will decide **who** is presenting the complaint.
*   **Anonymous Complaint:** Activate the "Anonymous Complaint" switch if you prefer not to share your personal data in the public document.
*   **Personal Data:** If you deactivate anonymous mode, you must enter your Full Name and Email. This is useful for receiving notifications about the progress of your case.
*   **Statistical Information (Optional):** You can fill in data such as age, gender, or occupation. This helps generate statistics but is not mandatory.

### Step 3: Evidence and Drafting
This is the most important step. Here you will describe **what** happened.
*   **AI Legal Assistant:** You will see a chat on the left. The assistant will ask you questions (What happened? When? Who?).
    *   Answer the questions in the chat.
    *   The AI will automatically draft a formal and legal description in the box on the right ("Live Legal Draft").
    *   The AI will also identify which law is being violated and which authority is responsible for addressing it.
*   **Search Mode:** You can switch the chat to "Consult Regulations" to ask specific questions like "What is the fine for littering?".
*   **Upload Photos/Files:** Use the "Upload" button to attach photos or documents that serve as proof of the incident.

### Step 4: Review and Submission
Before finishing, you will see a summary of your complaint.
*   **Preview:** On the right, you will see how the final document will look. Check that all data is correct.
*   **Download PDF:** You can download the document in PDF format to print it and take it personally if you wish.
*   **Sign and Submit:** Press this button to send the complaint digitally to our database. A tracking folio will be generated.

## Additional Functions

*   **Language Change:** In the top right, you can change the application language between Spanish (ES) and English (EN).
*   **Feedback:** On the right side, you will find a "Feedback" tab to send us your suggestions about the application.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Are my data safe?**
Yes. If you choose the anonymous complaint, your name will not appear in the generated document. If you provide your data, it is used only for tracking purposes.

**What do I do if the map doesn't load?**
Make sure you have an internet connection. If you use the "Detect my location" function, the browser will ask for permission; make sure to accept.

**Do I need to be a lawyer to use this?**
No. Artificial Intelligence takes care of translating your words into legal and technical language suitable for the authorities.
